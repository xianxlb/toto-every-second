# Toto Every Second

A real-time lottery simulation that demonstrates the astronomical odds of winning the jackpot. By simulating a draw once every single second, this project visualizes the mathematical difficulty of hitting the top prize.

## The Mathematics
* The odds of winning a typical 6/49 lottery jackpot are approximately 1 in 13,983,816. 
* Playing once per second, it would take approximately 162 days of continuous play to reach a 50% probability of winning once.
* A player purchasing one ticket per week would require approximately 268,920 years to reach the same probability.
